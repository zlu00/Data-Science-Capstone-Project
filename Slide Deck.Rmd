## The Objective

![](header.png)

The goal of this capstone is to mimic the experience of being a data scientist. As a practicing data scientist it is entirely common to get a messy data set, a vague question, and very little instruction on exactly how to analyze the data.

The base dataset is provided by SwiftKey, and the objective of this project is to build a shiny application to predict the next word after input of a phrase with multiple words.  

## Data Process and Analysis

- A subset of the original data was sampled from the three different sources (blogs, twitter and news), which was then merged into one.  
- Next, data was processed and cleaned up by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers and white spaces. 
- Then the corresponding unigram, bigram, trigram and quadgram were created and sorted in descending order.  
- Lastly, the strings stored in the n-grams objects were splited, and all the processed data was saved as RData files.

## Shinny App

- Processed data was first loaded.
- Next, user input was cleaned up in the same way as the base dataset was cleaned.  
- A simplified Katz's back-off model was performed.  
- For prediction of the next word, quadgram model - trigram model - bigram model - unigram model were used and searched in this order.  
- Lastly, prediction model selection and its result were returned to the screen.
